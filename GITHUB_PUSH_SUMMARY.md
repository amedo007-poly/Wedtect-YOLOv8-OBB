## 🚀 Complete Workflow (From README)

```bash
# 1. Scrape images (~45 min)
python scrape_google_images.py

# 2. Monitor progress
python monitor_scraper.py

# 3. Review images manually
explorer SCRAPED_IMAGES

# 4. Upload to Roboflow for annotation (1-2 hours)
# - Visit https://roboflow.com
# - Use AI auto-labeling
# - Export YOLOv8 format

# 5. Merge with original training data
python prepare_data_for_retraining.py

# 6. Retrain model (2-3 hours)
python train_gpu.py

# 7. Evaluate improvements
python evaluate_and_test.py

# 8. Push updated model to GitHub
git add . && git commit -m "Update: Improved model with expanded dataset" && git push
```

## 📈 Expected Results

**Dataset Expansion:**
- Original: 1,224 images
- New from scraping: 340+ images
- After Roboflow: ~1,500+ total images

**Expected Model Improvements:**
- Precision: 83.92% → 85-87% (+2-4%)
- Recall: 86.06% → 88-91% (+2-5%)
- mAP@50: 87.22% → 89-92% (+2-4%)

## ✅ Next Steps

### Option A: Continue Scraping (Recommended)
Keep the scraper running to reach 1000 images, then proceed with annotation and retraining.

```bash
python scrape_google_images.py
python monitor_scraper.py
```

### Option B: Use What You Have Now
Start annotation with current 340 images if time is limited.

```bash
# Upload SCRAPED_IMAGES/ to Roboflow now
# Then follow prepare_data_for_retraining.py → train_gpu.py
```
